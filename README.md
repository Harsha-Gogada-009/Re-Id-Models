# âš½ Football Player Tracking with YOLO + DeepSORT / BoT-SORT

This repository contains tracking pipelines for football player detection and tracking using:

- [best.pt](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-5fOSHOSB9UXyP_enOoZNAMScrePVcMD/view) for object detection
- DeepSORT and BoT-SORT for multi-object tracking (MOT)

Tested on a **15-second soccer match clip** for player re-identification

All dependencies and environmental requirements that are neccesary for model are already attached in ipynb files.

Detailed Documentation of the models are worked out in Report.pdf
